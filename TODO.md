#  TODO

- [ ] When compiling `highlight` avoid the creation of the static library `.a` before the CLI otherwise it will be linked in the executable instead of the dynamic one taking up space. 
- [ ] Sometime when compiling the app the custom plugins are not embedded.
- [ ] Update the application help.
