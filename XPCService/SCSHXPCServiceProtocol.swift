/*
 To use the service from an application or other process, use NSXPCConnection to establish a connection to the service by doing something like this:

    let connection = NSXPCConnection(serviceName: "org.sbarex.SourceCodeSyntaxHighlight.XPCService")
    connection.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(with: SCSHXPCServiceProtocol.self)
    connection.resume()

Once you have a connection to the service, you can use it like this:

    service = connection.remoteObjectProxyWithErrorHandler({ error in
        print("Received error:", error)
    }) as? XPCServiceProtocol
    service?.upperCaseString("hello") { aString in
        // We have received a response. Update our text field, but do it on the main thread.
        print("Result string was: \(aString)")
    }

 And, when you are finished with the service, clean up the connection like this:

     connection.invalidate()
